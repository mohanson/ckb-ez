# CKB Easy

CKB Easy is an experimental project that aims to provide human-friendly interfaces for common CKB operations. Note that CKB Easy is not a complete SDK, but only implements the CKB functions that I am interested in.

Features:

- No third-party dependencies. All code is visible.
- Incredibly simple.

```toml
[dependencies]
ckb-ez = "0.1.0"
```
